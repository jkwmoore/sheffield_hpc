JADE (Tier 2 GPU cluster)
=========================

`The Joint Academic Data Science Endeavour (JADE) <https://www.jade.ac.uk>`_ is the largest GPU facility in the UK supporting world-leading research in machine learning.

The computational hub harnesses the capabilities of the **NVIDIA DGX-1** Deep Learning System and comprise of **22 servers**, each containing **8 of the newest NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs** linked by NVIDIAâ€™s NV link interconnect technology. The new JADE facility aims to address the gap between university systems and access to national HPC services.

The `RSE`_ group director (Paul Richmond) is a co-investigator in the EPSRC Tier 2 JADE system. As such members of the University of Sheffield are able to access this resource for free (for use with deep learning research).

.. warning::

   JADE will be decommissioned in September 2021.  Existing JADE users should migrate to using :ref:`JADE 2 <jade2>` or :ref:`Bede <bede>`.
