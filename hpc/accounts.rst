Getting an Account
==================

Before you can start using the clusters you must first request HPC access. HPC access allows usage 
of all of our clusters (:ref:`Bessemer <bessemer>` and :ref:`ShARC <sharc>`).

--------

For Staff
^^^^^^^^^

HPC access is made available for staff by emailing their request to 
`it-servicedesk@sheffield.ac.uk <it-servicedesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

For Students
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following categories of students can also have HPC access with
the permission of their supervisors:

* Research Postgraduates
* Taught Postgraduates - for project work
* Undergraduates 3rd & 4th year  - for project work

To be granted HPC access, all students must first pass the 
`HPC Driving License test <https://infosecurity.shef.ac.uk/>`_. **(The VPN must be connected in order to 
access.)**

Following this, they should request that their academic supervisor fill in the HPC access 
request form which can be found at the 
`IT Service Desk Self Service Portal <https://shef.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/>`_ under the option 
Service Request Forms.

Once you have been granted HPC access by the service desk, you can use your normal 
Sheffield login credentials to connect to the clusters. 

For further details on how to connect to the clusters please read the 
section on :ref:`how to connect to the clusters<connecting>`.

Conditions for HPC access / usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::

   You must not share your account credentials or allow others to run jobs using your account. 
   Any misuse of accounts will be investigated in accordance with 
   the University of Sheffield's 
   `IT Code of Practice <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/codeofpractice/core>`__.


As a multiple user shared system, our clusters have some additional considerations in comparison 
to other IT Services provided at the University of Sheffield. Although we have strived to ensure 
that a robust baseline of security is in place suitable for the HPC community, we are aware 
that regulatory bodies and our research partners are asking for increasingly stringent security 
controls that the HPC may not have in place.

.. warning::

   The High Performance Computing service should not be used to store or process sensitive information.
   For example: medical records, personal information, financial data, commercially sensitive or 
   any other form of restricted data without first discussing your requirements with the Research IT Team - 
   research-it@sheffield.ac.uk 

Extra care should always be taken when dealing with sensitive information; if you are in any doubt about 
the sensitivity of information, or how it should be handled, then please contact IT Services 
`it-servicedesk@sheffield.ac.uk <it-servicedesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_ for advice.
